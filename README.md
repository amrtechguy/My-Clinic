# My Clinic
It's a console application of a clinic management system.

## How it works
When you build and open the program, you'll get a login screen that requires a username and a password. You can enter the default credentials as following, username: `admin` and password: `1234`. Once you login, you'll get a welcome screen with a list of available options that you can use by name or number. Each option has a specific function. Enter the option name or number in the console to take an action. Here's a list of the available options that you can use:

- `1. display doctors`

- `2. display doctor`

- `3. add doctor`

- `4. edit doctor`

- `5. delete doctor`


- `6. display patients`

- `7. display patient`

- `8. add patient`

- `9. edit patient`

- `10. delete patient`


- `11. display services`

- `12. display service`

- `13. add service`

- `14. edit service`

- `15. delete service`


- `16. display appointments`

- `17. display appointment`

- `18. add appointment`

- `19. edit appointment`

- `20. delete appointment`


- `21. edit account password`


- `22. help`

- `23. clear`

- `24. exit`

## The project structure
- `/include/`: this is for the project header files.

- `/src/`: this is for the project source files.

## Required libraries
- `sqlite3`: Download the amalgamation version here: [sqlite-amalgamation-3380200.zip](https://www.sqlite.org/2022/sqlite-amalgamation-3380200.zip). After downloading the file and unzipping it, get the header file `sqlite3.h` and add it to the directory `/include/` and get the source file `sqlite3.c` and add it to the directory `/src/`. You can download sqlite3 from the official website

## Environment where tested
- `IDE`: Visual Studio Code.

- `Compiler`: g++ (x86_64-posix-seh-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 8.1.0

- `Operating system`: Windows 10, 64-bit.
