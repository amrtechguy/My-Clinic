# My Clinic
It's a console application clinic management system.

## How it works
When you build and open the program, you'll get a login screen that requires a username and a password. You can enter the default credentials as following, username: `admin` and password: `1234`. Once you login, you'll get a welcome screen with a list of available options that you can use by name or number. Each option has a specific function. Enter the option name or number in the console to take an action. Here's a list of the available options that you can use:

- `list`: to list all tasks.

- `add`: to add a new task to the list.

- `remove`: to remove a task from the list.

- `help`: to display a list of valid shortcuts.

- `exit`: to exit the menu.

## The project structure
- `/.vscode/`: this is for the configuration files of vscode editor on windows.

- `/bin/`: this is for the project binary files or executable files.

- `/include/`: this is for the project header files.

- `/src/`: this is for the project source files.
